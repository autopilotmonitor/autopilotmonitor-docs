* **Update**: Added a **Scheduled** entry to `troubleshooting/service-announcements.md` announcing planned infrastructure maintenance (Sat 18 Jul – Mon 20 Jul 2026, 00:00 CEST) during which the platform is unavailable; agents buffer locally and re-sync afterwards. Linked from the portal dashboard and landing-page maintenance banners. Also added a temporary `warning` hint at the top of the `README.md` Welcome page pointing to the announcement.

* **Creation**: Added `reference/optional-graph-permissions.md` — customer-facing how-to for opt-in tenant-side Microsoft Graph add-on permissions (`appRoleAssignment` grants via `Grant-AutopilotMonitorAddOn.ps1`), migrated from the contributor tech-docs bundle where it did not belong. Wired into `SUMMARY.md` and `index.md` under Reference; added a pointer from `reference/settings.md`.

* **Creation**: Converted the customer documentation repository into an OKF v0.1 knowledge bundle — added `type` and `tags` YAML frontmatter fields to all 38 content pages (existing GitBook `description` fields kept as the OKF `description`), created `index.md` (bundle entry point) and this log. GitBook structure files (`README.md`, `SUMMARY.md`, `.gitbook.yaml`) are unchanged.
